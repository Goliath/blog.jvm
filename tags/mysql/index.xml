mysqldump database &amp;gt; database_dump.sql Dump file size was ~3GB which might take quite long. Especially when the connection to mysql server was not fast enough.
Solution After a few attempts and noticing that it might take too long to fetch all data I found out that there is a nice switch in mysql and mysqldump commands.
--compress, -C Switch will tell mysql server to compress the dump on the fly so you can save a lot of bandwidth.</description></item></channel></rss>
