Most of the time, we&amp;rsquo;re experiencing stackoverflow exception when thread in the JVM application has too long call chain. That can result in eating up all stack memory by stack frames. JVM has safe defaults for stack memory region and usually it&amp;rsquo;s around 1MB. If you encounter StackoverflowException, most likely you&amp;rsquo;re using recursion in your application - either planned or not :)
The default thread stack space can be found by executing:</description></item><item><title>Introduction to Java ergonomics</title><link>https://bitecode.blog/2024/04/20/java-ergonomics-basics/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bitecode.blog/2024/04/20/java-ergonomics-basics/</guid><description>Intro It&amp;rsquo;s not a secret that JVM is an extremly complex execution environment. It has many options that can be set to tune the application execution. What happens if we don&amp;rsquo;t set any of them or we pick only few? In this article I will explain what is Java ergonomics and how it works to supply default JVM options. I will also tell why it&amp;rsquo;s never safe to rely on the defaults.</description></item></channel></rss>
