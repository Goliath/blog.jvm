While introducing it was a great step forward, as developers stopped reinventing the wheel and write the same (still complex) bolierplate code. As we later learned it also opened a pandora box. I will try to describe the problem in below article.
Problem This process of serialization involves converting the state of an object into a byte stream, which can then be reverted back into a copy of the object.</description></item></channel></rss>
