if(object?.value &amp;gt; 0) { println &amp;#34;do something&amp;#34; } else { println &amp;#34;do nothing&amp;#34; } Are you sure what will be printed when object is null? I must say I wasn’t.
We got used to negate null in groovy like this:
assert !null == true but what about using null with relation operator?
Comparing null Let us review below code:
assert null &amp;lt; 0 assert null &amp;lt; Integer.</description></item><item><title>Dumping large MySQL database</title><link>https://bitecodeblog.codeappeal.com/2016/05/14/mysql-dump-large-database/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bitecodeblog.codeappeal.com/2016/05/14/mysql-dump-large-database/</guid><description>Problem Not going into details of credentials basic mysqldump command looks like this:
mysqldump database &amp;gt; database_dump.sql Dump file size was ~3GB which might take quite long. Especially when the connection to mysql server was not fast enough.
Solution After a few attempts and noticing that it might take too long to fetch all data I found out that there is a nice switch in mysql and mysqldump commands.
--compress, -C Switch will tell mysql server to compress the dump on the fly so you can save a lot of bandwidth.</description></item><item><title>Log Levels Performance</title><link>https://bitecodeblog.codeappeal.com/2016/05/14/log-levels-performance/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bitecodeblog.codeappeal.com/2016/05/14/log-levels-performance/</guid><description>Problem Take an example with grails log.debug() call. Let’s say I want to log a very often executed code.
Long sum = 0 (1..1000).each { number -&amp;gt; ++sum log.debug &amp;#34;Sum = ${sum}&amp;#34; } I use log.debug so my information is logged only if my project configuration allows that. That way if we turn off DEBUG, the logged line should not affect application speed. But is that really true?
Let’s check if the logged value is really not accessed?</description></item><item><title>Welcome to Bitecode Blog</title><link>https://bitecodeblog.codeappeal.com/2016/05/01/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bitecodeblog.codeappeal.com/2016/05/01/hello-world/</guid><description> “Yeah It&amp;rsquo;s on. ”
