&lt;p>when checking git log or GitHub commits history we can see that each commit has a corresponding author.
We learned to trust that information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What if I told you that this information can be easily spoofed?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-git-log">What is git log&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Every time we commit changes to the git repository, git stores information about the author of the commit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This information is stored per commit object and can be displayed by executing &lt;code>git log&lt;/code> command.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Serialization exploits in JVM</title><link>https://bitecode.blog/2024/04/05/jvm-serialization-exploits/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bitecode.blog/2024/04/05/jvm-serialization-exploits/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="intro">Intro&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) provides a mechanism for persisting Java objects, known as serialization.
When introducing, it was a great step forward, as developers stopped reinventing the wheel and writing the same (still complex) boilerplate code.
As we later learned it also opened a pandora box. I will try to describe the problem in the article below.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="problem">Problem&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This process of serialization involves converting the state of an object into a byte stream, which can then be reverted back into a copy of the object.
That way we can persist any object, store it, then load whenever we want.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
